# MotionWorks support-engineer implementation status

This is work in progress. Version 0.5.5 did not establish complete IDE control.

## Proven follow-up patch for 0.5.5

- Trial detection selects only mwctVerify-owned Windows Forms dialogs containing
  an exact Use Trial button, and keeps that button paired with its own dialog.
  Regression cases cover unrelated Windows Forms windows, absent/hidden controls,
  a later buttonless verifier window, and multiple matching dialogs.
- Startup checks trial prompts even when a process or blocked IDE frame exists.
  It performs one UI Automation Invoke (or posted native button action if Invoke
  is unavailable before submission), then checks closure; no blind mutation retry.
- Live startup on 2026-10-01: already_running=false, trial_dialog=true,
  trial_answered=true, IDE version=1.19, ide_enabled=true, blocked=false,
  dialog_count=0. The disposable stage was opened; no controller action occurred.
- Installed Ade.tlb proves Variables.Create has seven inputs: Name, Type,
  BlockType, Description, InitialValue, IecAddress, Retain. The previous probes
  included incorrect argument shapes; these do not disprove the actual API.
- `test/native_api_probe.ps1` created and saved CodexApiLocal in the disposable
  TopCutterCutControl: count 149→150, INT, block type 1, initializer 7, empty
  address, description Native API probe. This is a native-call probe, not yet a
  public guarded addition tool or whole-worksheet collateral-change proof.
- OpenDocument still returns Internal error, including with SAFEARRAY(VARIANT)*
  supplied to its UserData input. Do not expose it as verified navigation.
- Public `mw_ide_variable_change` passed local add/edit/delete in the disposable
  stage: counts 150→151→151→150, complete saved and raw native declarations
  matched, with native flags preserved. Saved comment padding is normalized only
  for baseline alignment; exact raw native before/after checks remain intact.
- Full regression suite and package dry-run passed. Native global/external
  lifecycle and group moves are not established by the local lifecycle test.
- After the local lifecycle, fresh Build passed with an observed pending-to-
  compiled transition (6.9 seconds), modified=false. Make settled successfully
  as already up to date (2.2 seconds). No controller action occurred.

## Required remaining capability evidence

| Requirement | Evidence needed / current status |
|---|---|
| Startup and trial | Passed disposable launch; install reload still required |
| Named worksheet navigation | Public guarded operation and exact active-view verification; incomplete |
| POU add/edit/delete | Native lifecycle with independent saved inventory and reference checks; incomplete |
| Local/global/external variables | Public native local add/edit/delete and full saved/native comparisons passed; global/external lifecycle remains unverified |
| Tasks and POU assignment | Existing tools need complete live lifecycle verification for required operations |
| POU code editing | Deterministic native editor route, full saved body comparison and compilation; incomplete |
| Toolbox and FB insertion | Installed interface/pin inspection, editor insertion/wiring, declaration and build verification; incomplete |
| Support-engineering judgment | Version-aware reference lookup, engineering diagnosis and tested operation workflows; existing guidance alone is insufficient |

Next implementation: verify the guarded native tool against globals and externals.
Continue navigation and POU/code/
toolbox work separately; do not mark the support-engineer objective complete from
these startup and declaration probes.
